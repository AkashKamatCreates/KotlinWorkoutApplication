# Workout Application :)
### Problem Statement:
I faced problem Counting dropsets during workouts. Inaccurate counts can be confusing...
### Solution: 
I've Developed a static application that automatically detects the day and assigns a Push, Pull, Legs (PPL) split accordingly. Users can easily record dropsets using a checklist feature.

### Result:
temporary checklists make it easy for user to remember recent workout sets...
